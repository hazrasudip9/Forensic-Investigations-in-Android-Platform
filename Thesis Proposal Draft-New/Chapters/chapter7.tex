\label{chap:plan}

Our Development Plan is as follows:\\
\section{Things To be Done}
1.Creating a java/scala based cloud file system with support for multiple cloud storage providers.\\
2.Creating a new EXT4 partition in the android device (/forensic partition).\\
3.Creating a Android Rootkit based on ARM architecture to highjack system calls to subvert various linux commands which might compromise our file system.\\

I am now currently looking at various java based cloud file systems which can be incorporated into Android.\\
 
Exploring if google firebase can be used for this purpose.\\

Our Implementation will be done in Linux machine and then we will port it to Android.
