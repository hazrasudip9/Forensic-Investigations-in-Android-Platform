                 ensuring this data is not compromised after a
                 confiscation of the device are not readily available.
                 DroidStealth is an open source {Android} application
                 which combines data encryption and application
                 obfuscation techniques to provide users with a way to
                 securely hide content on their smartphones. This
                 includes hiding the application’s default launch
                 methods and providing methods such as dial-to-launch or
                 invisible launch buttons. A novel technique provided by
                 DroidStealth is the ability to transform its appearance
                 to be able to hide in plain sight on devices. To
                 achieve this, it uses self-compilation, without
                 requiring any special permissions. This Two-Layer

abstract = "Abstract: In many digital forensic investigations, email data needs to be analyzed. However, this poses a threat to the privacy of the individual whose emails are being examined and in particular becomes a problem if the investigation clashes with privacy laws. This is commonly addressed by allowing the investigator to run keyword searches and to reveal only those emails that contain at least some of the keywords. While this could be realized with standard cryptographic techniques, further requirements are present that call for novel solutions: (i) for investigation-tactical reasons the investigator should be able to keep the search terms secret and (ii) for efficiency reasons no regular interaction should be required between the investigator and the data owner. We close this gap by introducing a novel cryptographic scheme that allows to encrypt entire email boxes before handing them over for investigation. The key feature is that the investigator can non-interactively run keyword searches on the encrypted data and decrypt those emails (and only those) for which a configurable number of matches occurred. Our implementation as a plug-in for a standard forensic framework confirms the practical applicability of the approach. "

Abstract. At the end of 2011, Google released version 4.0 of its Android
operating system for smartphones. For the first time, Android
smartphone owners were supplied with a disk encryption feature that
transparently scrambles user partitions, thus protecting sensitive user
information against targeted attacks that bypass screen locks. On the
downside, scrambled telephones are a a nightmare for IT forensics and
law enforcement, because once the power of a scrambled device is cut any
chance other than bruteforce is lost to recover data.
In this paper we present Frost, a tool set that supports the forensic
recovery of scrambled telephones. To this end we perform cold boot
attacks against Android smartphones and retrieve disk encryption keys
from RAM. We show that cold boot attacks against Android phones
are generally possible for the first time, and we perform our attacks
practically against Galaxy Nexus devices from Samsung. To break disk
encryption, the bootloader must be unlocked before the attack because
scrambled user partitions are wiped during unlocking. However, we show
that cold boot attacks are more generic and allow to retrieve sensitive
information, such as contact lists, visited web sites, and photos, directly
from RAM, even though the bootloader is locked.

                 State Gujarat, India; Abstract The modern day
                 Smartphone's have built in apps like "WhatsApp \&
                 Viber" which allow users to exchange instant messages,
                 share videos, audio's and images via Smartphone's
                 instead of relying on their desktop Computers or laptop
                 thereby increasing the portability and convenience for
                 a layman smart phone user. An Instant Messenger (IM)
                 can serve as a very useful yet very dangerous platform
                 for the victim and the suspect to communicate. The
                 increased use of Instant messengers on {Android} phones
                 has turned to be the goldmine for mobile and computer
                 forensic experts. Traces and Evidence left by
                 applications can be held on {Android} phones and
                 retrieving those potential evidences with right
                 forensic technique is strongly required. This paper
                 focuses on conducting forensic data analysis of 2
                 widely used IMs applications on {Android} phones:
                 WhatsApp and Viber. 5 {Android} phones were analyzed
                 covering 3 different versions of {Android} OS: Froyo (2.
                 2), GingerBread (2. 3. x) and Ice-Cream Sandwich (4. 0.
                 x). The tests and analysis were performed with the aim
                 of determining what data and information can be found
                 on the device's internal memory for instant messengers
                 e. g. chat messaging logs and history, send \& received
                 image or video files, etc. Determining the location of
                 data found from FileSystem Extraction of the device was
                 also determined. The experiments and results show that
                 heavy amount of potential evidences and valuable data
                 can be found on {Android} phones by forensic
                 investigators.},",
