  Küpper Toumas Aura, , Technical University of Berlin Instructor:
  Gökhan Coskun; Abstract: Generated data by users is increasing daily
  and maintaining the personal data storage hardware is costly. Cloud
  data storage are getting popular for their user friendly and cost
  effective features. On the other hand, user privacy violation is an
  obstacle for adoption of cloud storage. Therefore, the recent
  growing interest in both public cloud and private storage services,
  shows the demand for solutions that are focusing on privacy
  awareness of users.  Increasing the security and privacy related
  issues in cloud storages indicate a demand for an action to improve
  the security of data storage and increase privacy awareness. In this
  thesis, a novel trust level based solution for cloud data storage is
  introduced. This solution emphasizes in utilizing hybrid cloud
  technologies. This solution provides a simple user interface based
  on colors and it gives the possibility of selecting the storing
  places very easily and efficiently.  Furthermore, to have a detail
  requirements of our solution a survey study based on questionnaire
  is administered and a proof of concept prototype is developed. }, }
