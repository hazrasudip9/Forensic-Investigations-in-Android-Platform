Amrita-beamer
=============
Beamer is a LaTeX class for creating slides for presentations. 
This repository contains the beamer presentation of the Amrita University.

How to compile
==============
If you are using GNU/Linux box, I would suggest you to install
texmaker editor and texlive-full package to compile any LaTeX 
files. 


`$ sudo apt-get install texmaker texlive-full`

(only applicable for debian based machines) 

Once you open the tex file using the texmaker, you can run a quick-build to 
compile and get the PDF file as output.
