\label{chap:Conclusion And Future Work}
\initial{F}orensic Investigation is becoming increasingly complex day by day. The onset of mobile computing and end-to-end encryption implies that smartphones can now compute more complex data and this has facilitated in development of applications which uses end-to-end encryption for message encryption, In such scenarios even Man-in-the-middle attacks are not successful.Smartphones memory  can be erased with 
applications which erase and over-write the memory multiple times with 0, making the device unfit for forensic evidence collection.In such scenarios, A proactive forensic framework is necessary which will be able to monitor suspected criminals 24 x 7. This forensic framework will be able monitor the suspects with maximum accuracy and stealth. The evidence files will be directly copied to the cloud drive which will opportunistically upload it to the cloud server for analysis.The android cloud storage service will also be helpful in case of malware detection services which require to store large amounts of data for static and dynamic analysis.
