@article{flip2015,
  title={FLIP: an Internetwork Protocol for Supporting Distributed Systems
Distributed Systems},
  author={M. Frans Kaashoek and Robbert van Renesse and Hans van Staveren and Andrew S. Tanenbaum},
  year={2015},
 annote = { Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, The Netherlands ABSTRACT
                  Most modern network protocols give adequate support
                  for traditional applications such as file transfer
                  and remote login. Distributed applications, however,
                  have different requirements (e.g., efficient
                  atmost-once remote procedure call even in the face
                  of processor failures). Instead of using ad-hoc
                  protocols to meet each of the new requirements, we
                  have designed a new protocol, called the Fast Local
                  Internet Protocol (FLIP), that provides a clean and
                  simple integrated approach to these new
                  requirements. FLIP is an unreliable message protocol
                  that provides both point-to-point communication and
                  multicast communication, and requires almost no
                  network management.  Furthermore, by using FLIP we
                  have simplified higher-level protocols such as
                  remote procedure call and group communication, and
                  enhanced support for process migration and
                  security. A prototype implementation of FLIP has
                  been built as part of the new kernel for the Amoeba
                  distributed operating system, and is in daily
                  use. Measurements of its performance are presented.
