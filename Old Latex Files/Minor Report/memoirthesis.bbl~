  or develop custom modules in Java or Python. The Sleuth Kit is a collection
  of command line tools and a C library that allows you to analyze disk images
  and recover files from them. It is used behind the scenes in Autopsy and many
  other open source and commercial forensics tools. ;;

:: Friedrich-Alexander University of Erlangen-Nuremberg; October 2012;
  Abstract. At the end of 2011, Google released version 4.0 of its Android
  operating system for smartphones. For the first time, Android smartphone
  owners were supplied with a disk encryption feature that transparently
  scrambles user partitions, thus protecting sensitive user information against
  targeted attacks that bypass screen locks. On the downside, scrambled
  telephones are a a nightmare for IT forensics and law enforcement, because
  once the power of a scrambled device is cut any chance other than bruteforce
  is lost to recover data. In this paper we present Frost, a tool set that
  supports the forensic recovery of scrambled telephones. To this end we
  perform cold boot attacks against Android smartphones and retrieve disk
  encryption keys from RAM. We show that cold boot attacks against Android
  phones are generally possible for the first time, and we perform our attacks
  practically against Galaxy Nexus devices from Samsung. To break disk
  encryption, the bootloader must be unlocked before the attack because
  scrambled user partitions are wiped during unlocking. However, we show that
  cold boot attacks are more generic and allow to retrieve sensitive
  information, such as contact lists, visited web sites, and photos, directly
  from RAM, even though the bootloader is locked. ;;
