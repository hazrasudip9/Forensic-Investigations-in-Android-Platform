\chapter{Typewriting Conventions}

You will be working with the source files of LaTeX for several months.
So, it is almost as important how the text is laid out in these files
as how good the printed result looks.

\begin{enumerate}
\item
Use Title Case: \url{https://www.google.com/webhp?&ion=1&#q=title+case}

\item
Don't let any line be longer than around 70 chars.  Learn the
``auto-fill'' and LaTeX modes, and ``fill-paragraph'' function of
Emacs.

\item
A comma should never have a preceding blank.  Same with several other
punctuation characters: !;:.\%

\item
Sentences are separated by two blanks.  Emacs can then do
sentence-level editing.

\item
Separate the paragraphs with one empty line.

\item
Section headings should appear by themselves on a line.  Leave two blank
lines above and one below these.

\item
The characters \verb|#&_%[]{}| are special in {\TeX}.  If you must use
them, you have to enclose them in either in the verbatim mode as in
\verb/\verb|#&_%[]{}|/ or provide escape sequences.

\item
In programming opening and closing quotes are the same.  In \LaTeX{},
open quotes are \verb|`| or \verb|``| and the corresponding closing
quotes are \verb|'| or \verb|''|.

\item
It is a good idea to end each of your files with the line \\
\verb|%-eof-|.
\end{enumerate}
