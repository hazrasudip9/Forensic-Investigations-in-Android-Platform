\chapter{Learning {\TeX} and {\LaTeX}}

Of course, you {\em should} learn {{\TeX} and {\LaTeX}}!  But, more
importantly you should produce a well-written thesis, that contributes
to existing knowledge, in the time you have.

The files of {\tt thesisExample.tbz} should be enough if you can learn
via examples.

There are many tutorials of varying length, from a few pages to
hundreds of pages; e.g., \cite{WikiBooks}.  The original books are by
\cite{Knuth} who designed and implemented \TEX{}, and \cite{Lamport},
who developed the \LaTeX{}.  ``The Comprehensive TeX Archive Network
\url{http://www.ctan.org/} is the authoritative collection of
materials related to the TeX typesetting system.''

Use {\tt pdflatex} to produce pdf files directly.  Most theses use
{\tt url} and {\tt hyperref} packages\footnote{to produce links such
  as {\LaTeX{} Cheat Sheet} \url{https://wch.github.io/latexsheet/}}.
Note that the LaTeX/pmthesis.cls already includes these.
