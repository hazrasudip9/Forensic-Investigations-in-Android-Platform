\chapter{Introduction}

I want all my students to typeset their work using \LaTeX{}.  To
reduce their effort in doing this, I give this report and the
accompanying \LaTeX{} files as an example to learn from.  The details
of \LaTeX{} as used in these example files is sufficient to most of
their documents.

\section{Advice}

\begin{quote}
{\hfill{}``Down with MS Word. Long live \LaTeX.}''  
\end{quote}

\noindent
This is the underlying sentiment in this article.

I recommend various things below without justifying them.  This keeps
the article short.

\section{``I say so.''}

Besides, I have some dictatorial powers over my students ``{\tt
  ;-)}''.  And, these are CS students.  They are supposed to be able
to learn new languages and tools fast!  No?

\section{Length}

There are really no rules about the length of a chapter.  But should a
chapter be this short?
